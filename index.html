			<p>I enjoy working in both physical and digital spaces, collaborating with multiple design disciplines to create unique interactions and experiences. I work to synthesize and develop designs through research and prototyping.</p>
		</div>
		<article>
			<p>I've had a passion for design since a young age. In university I realized I wanted to be passionate about my work and transferred from Psychology to the Interactive Art & Technology program at <a href="http://www.sfu.ca">Simon Fraser University</a>. I became exposed to many types of design including graphic, industrial, spatial and interaction.</p>
			
			<p> A few of my projects include the <a href="/projects/living-shade/">Living Shade</a> and <a href="/projects/kitchen-system/">N1 Kitchen System</a>. In my Living Shade project I led the design for my team of five in an eight month long capstone project to develop a working dynamic shading system balancing plant and human life. The Kitchen System started out as a three week long study on interaction design but ended up letting me explore many new ideas, concepts and inspirations. I have learned to explore ideas from the large scale down the the smallest details, valuing every element of a design.
			
			<p> While I enjoy many types of design I have constantly gravitated towards interaction. I graduated from Simon Fraser in June 2012 with my Bachelor of Arts in Interactive Art & Technology. Currently Product Designer at Bench.</p>
