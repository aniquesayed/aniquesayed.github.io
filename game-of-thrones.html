			<p>The Living Shade is an indoor green wall shading system that intelligently provides shade based on user requirements. The highly customizable system uses translucent rotating panels to allow specific amounts of sunlight into the room. Plants provide aesthetic shading, balancing both the function and beauty of nature.</p>

			<p>The development of the system began with testing and evaluating how users responded to balancing plant life and their own shade requirements. Creating scenarios and tests to simulate living with the shade provided information and eventual inspiration into progressing the design.</p>

   			<p>We then developed a functional prototype of our design using an iPhone as the system's controller. This allowed us to get closer to understanding the interactions of the system and reduce the technological barriers of lower fidelity prototypes. Users were able to fully interact with various elements of the prototype providing real-time changes to the system.</p>

    			<p>Our team constructed a wall with the Living Shade built in. Using lighting kits we were able to simulate an entire day of interacting with the system and evaluate the experience users had when playing out daily routines. The prototype's panels were constructed using laser cut acrylic and uniquely designed 3D printed components. The system was built using highly accurate step motors controlled through Arduino and Processing while wirelessly connected to an iPhone as the interface.</p>

  			<p>A web interface was proposed and evaluated to provide functional control over the system while at or away from the home. Status bars displayed quantifiable levels of the Living Shade while the image of the plant provided a visualization of the system, changing from a healthy to a wilting plant, reflecting the system's health. Individual panel orientation control provided quick adjustments. An alarm function lets the shades open at a scheduled time to provide sunlight as a natural alarm.</p>

   			<p>Phone and tablet interfaces were proposed to provide mobile functionality of the system. Users could be anywhere in the home and adjust the system's settings.</p>

    			<p>An important element of the system was the customizable presets which allowed the user to create preset shading locations. If the user wanted to watch television but keep the rest of the room in light the shades would adjust to provide shade just where the television is and where the seating is. During homework time the system would provide shade where the family sits together and does homework. Presets allowed the the system to become an active participant in the user's daily life.</p>
